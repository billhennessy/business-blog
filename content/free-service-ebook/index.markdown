I am a better person because I served.
The US Navy did far more for me than I did for the Navy.




I was a better person the day I left active duty than I am today. But I'm better today than I would have been had I not served.




I wrote a 5-part series of posts on the need for a new service ethos in America. This idea isn't mine. William F. Buckley wrote about the need in _Four Reforms_ (1974) and in _Gratitude_ (1990). Eric Greitens, Navy SEAL, humanitarian, Rhodes Scholar, charity founder, has promoted service his whole life. I simply echo their great ideas.
