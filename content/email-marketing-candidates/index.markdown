I recently blogged about [the need for Republican marketing consultants](/hennessys-view/2013/09/07/republicans-need-marketing-consultants), and I made a promise: I will put together a research paper for libertarian and conservative campaigns.




#### If you're running for office, you need to know the science of email.




That's why I wrote this 11-page report: 9 Email Marketing Mistakes I Made So You Don't Have To.




It's free if you're a conservative or libertarian candidate in Missouri.




Inside you'll find:





  * 9 mistakes I've made and learned from
  * The science behind emails that get opened and acted on
  * The secrets of killer subject lines
  * How to drive up your click-thru rates
  * A printable checklist to use on every email you send
  * More



Yes, this is free.




With the 2014 election season starting now, you can't afford to wait a day to download and read this report.
