Hi. I'm Bill Hennessy. Welcome to my blog.




"Beauty is the ultimate defense against complexity," wrote David Gelernter.




This blog promotes simple strategies to make work, home, and life better. I rely on science about the brain to help you make art that moves people. Well, science and my own opinion.




I hope you enjoy and contribute.




**I help design simple solutions for some of the world's greatest companies**. I founded a small portion of a large movement. I am an author and a speaker.  I will help you if I can.
