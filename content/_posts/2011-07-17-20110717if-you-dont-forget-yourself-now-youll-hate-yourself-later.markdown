I heard a classic the other day.  A business executive claimed that the reason his company is losing market share is -- are you ready for this?:




"We haven't done a good job of communicating our objectives."




Really?  Do you, Mr. Executive, believe that customers give two pro-formas about _your_ objectives. 







![Stopwatch1](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56c87f52356fb0ec8c23c9b7/t/56d090ffd9fd567b5dd39b16/1456509183367/stopwatch1-scaled500.jpg)








Unless you've reached true loyalty (which very, very few organizations have), your customers don't even care if you're in business next week, as long as someone's handling the warranty.  So get over yourself.  Get over your objectives.  Get over your goals, your proformas, your strategies, and all the other buzzwords swimming round in your ego-dominated brain.




Instead of asking your customers to understand your objectives, try _satisfying your customer's objectives_.




Take the advice of a man who made lots of money and developed _true loyalty_ without an MBA or a team of lawyers.




<blockquote>Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers. Make every decision--even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone--according to what's best for your customers.

**That's what Persuasive Design is all about.**




Persuasive Design means processes, systems, products, and programs that help people get they want, in the context of your business or organization. It's not about what you want as an executive.




Persuasive Design has been around awhile in architecture and machines.  It's akin to[ B. J. Fogg's Persuasive Technology](http://www.bjfogg.com/). Only here we're talking about applying it to everything you do for your customers, from the way you answer your phones to the story you live into.




A lot of processes, applications, products, and forms have persuasive elements already.  But most of those came about as accidents or in response to user complaints. Persuasive Design is very intentional.  And it's all about putting your customers first.




**Persuasive Design is spreading fast.**




Heard of _gamification?_ Gamification means thinking like a game designer while you're making anything.  It's the secret ingredient in Groupon, Foursquare, Twitter, Facebook, etc. 




Your customers want and expect what they do with you to feel more like a game, to be more fun, to take them where they want to go.  They don't care where _you_ want them to go. Not anymore.




Brands like American Express get Persuasive Design. That's why they're hooking up with Zynga and Facebook and all the other makers of game-like systems.




You don't have to put your customers first, last, and in between.  But someone in your field will.  And then you're screwed. 




So take a little warm advice. Listen to Derek Sivers. 




**BONUS**:  Take a big leap forward in your Persuasive Design skill by reading this [brilliant Declaration on player-centric design](http://natronbaxter.com/declaration_of_player_stewardship) from the [Applied Gaming Masters of the Universe at Natron-Baxter](http://natronbaxter.com).  You'll hate yourself if your competitors read it first.
