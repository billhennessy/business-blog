At the funeral mass for a nasty, stingy, mean-spirited, reviled parishioner, the priest asked someone from the congregation to recall at least one positive trait of the departed.

Silence.




“I can’t believe that a man can walk the earth for seventy-plus years and not touch a single person in a positive, loving way,” the priest said.




Nothing.




“I know many of us had our differences with Mr. Gilford, but this is his _funeral_ _mass_ and we are Christians. I won’t continue until someone says a kind word about our departed brother.”




A few coughs echoed through the church. Some people nervously paged their missals.




After a few minutes of quiet, a man in an old, gray overcoat rose slowly to his feet. He cleared his throat and said, “The brother was even worse.” 




What Will They Say About You?




Will people line up to share your wonderful life stories at your funeral? Will they show up at the funeral home out of love and loss or out of a sense of obligation—to be seen? Or only to comfort those you leave behind, silently joyful that their lives are now free from the burden of . . . you?
