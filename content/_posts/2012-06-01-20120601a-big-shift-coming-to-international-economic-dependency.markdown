It's insane not address global business. And yet . . .
And yet generational historians William Strauss and Neil Howe, who have a remarkable 20-year track record of accuracy, predict that the next 15 years will see an increase in nationalism that reduces global economic ties. "[T]he economy will have changed fundamentally. Compared to today, it will be less globally dependent, with smaller cross-border trade and capital flows."




Already, we're seeing increases in US manufacturing. In Europe, economic nationalism is on a rapid rise as Greece, Spain, Italy, and Portugal demand capital from Germany.

The fashion industry is mired in crisis. The global economy is struggling, there's no end in sight for the European slowdown and the end of cheap Chinese manufacturing is approaching.
