]() I had a small revelation yesterday: there are two paths to focus.




One path requires constant vigilance against distraction. This path also demands great awareness, knowledge, and outlandish tenacity. This is the path we recognize as heroic. 




The other path gets less notice, less acclaim. Of those who follow this second path, you never see them trying. These are the “naturals,” it seems. Things come easy for them. 




But the second path requires a lot of work, too.




The first path to focus makes your eye (or eyes) hurt. You strain to place all of your concentration onto one tiny speck. You squint and squeeze your eyeball. That speck could be a planet billions of miles away or it could be a subatomic particle. Both require massive, focused concentration. The person who achieves this concentration earns praise as a hero and hard worker.




The second path to focus requires learning to eliminate everything but the target. Instead of mastering concentration, you master release and surrender. You let go of everything that’s not the object of your study or the target of your arrow. You think, see, and understand less and less until, at last, there is nothing in your universe except you and the target.




Then you release the arrow. It has no choice but to strike the target, because nothing else exists.




Following the second path to focus will earn less praise for hard work and genius because it looks easy. But when the two paths cross, those on the second path will triumph every time.
