“What did you learn today?”
My dad asked me that question every night at dinner.




“Nothing,” I said.




Dad didn’t press. He wasn’t like that. But he planted a seed that’s been with me ever since. It was the curiosity seed.




Even though I never—or rarely—told him what I learned, I learned. And I noticed it.




You know those productivity tips that always say “do the most important thing first?” For me, the most important thing is to learn something new.




Here are the 5 best blogs in the world for learning something new every day.





  1. [Barking Up the Wrong Tree](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/) (science-packed stories on why we do what we do)
  2. [Don Peppers on LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/influencer/17102372) (business and life)
  3. [Letters of Note](http://www.lettersofnote.com/) (great letters that you might have missed)
  4. [Dan Ariely](http://danariely.com/) (psychology you can use)
  5. [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/) (everyday tips for better living)
