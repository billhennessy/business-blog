I got all excited last night.
I’m not a huge Starbuck’s fan, but I go there often enough.  I haven't  joined their loyalty program, but something on [Mashable pushed me to join](http://mashable.com/2011/01/18/starbucks-mobile-payments/).




Until I actually tried.

]()Mashable said that Starbuck’s was rolling out mobile payment to all of its company-owned stores on Wednesday, January 19.  All I needed was a (free) iPhone app and either a credit card or PayPal account to load cash to the app.




I loved it.




Until I tried it.




The app installed simply enough.  But I had to fill out a lot of information on the iPhone’s difficult keyboard.  Then I leaned that I needed to go into store and purchase a physical card.  Or I could order one online.  Either way, I had to first buy a piece of plastic.




Seriously?




I want to load up mobile pay so I can avoid buying a piece of plastic that will shortly end up in a landfill, but I can’t.




Never mind.
