Did you know an obscure federal bureaucracy is damaging your liver?

And they're using your brain to their dirty work.

If you're an American adult, chances are you drink alcohol, at least occasionally. And every sip you take does a little damage to your body's number one toxin-fighter: the liver.

But it doesn't have to be that way.

A technology called NTX actually blocks the liver-killing effects of alcohol by combining some remarkable ingredients in a unique way. The science behind NTX is solid and accepted by the U.S. government, but a power-hungry bureau of called the TTB (Tax and Trade Bureau) prohibits anyone from talking about NTX and its potential life-saving effects.

The TTB's mindless censorship hurts people in two ways. The obvious damage is denying people access to information that could save their lives or, at least, limit liver damage. That's immediate and personal. The second and broader damage the TTB does is to discourage innovation and creativity in improving the healthiness of foods.

To a casual observer, it looks like the TTB is actually protecting big incumbent companies from market threats posed by a new technology that the incumbents could have implement but didn't. (Seriously. The inventor offered his technology to five of the biggest alcohol producers, and they told him to take a hike.)

If you're a fan of innovation, free markets, and healthy food, you might want to learn more about NTX, Chigurupati Technologies, and the TTB's unholy alliance with big businesses that want to thwart innovation and health. Here are some links:

**Disclosure**: [I](http://saferalcohol.com/blog/introducing-the-coalition-for-safer-alcohols-spokesperson/) am the national spokesperson for the Coalition for Safer Drinking. The spineless bureaucrats at TTB do not want you to read my new book _Fight to Evolve_. Don't read it unless you drink and like free speech and innovation. Or really romantic stories about puppies and balloons. 

### Want me to tell you how to get the book? Just tell me where to write:
