But I had to.




This blog is about simple solutions, not complete control. The amount of extra meaning I could create with the control I had in WP just didn't make up for the comlexity I had to manage.




We make trade-off like this one all the time. We give up something that we _think _we need to get more of what we really want. Giving up total control of my blog was painful, but the freedom to let someone else worry upgrades and plug-ins is worth it.And Posterous is very well put together.




What controls have you let go of?
