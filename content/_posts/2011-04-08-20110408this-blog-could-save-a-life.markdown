When you hear the [Tylenol case study](http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/fall02/susi/tylenol.htm), do you want to puke?
[![spirit1]()
]()Sure, it’s a great story of how a responsible company handles a crisis.  If you’ve never heard it, it goes like this:




People in Chicago were dying after taking Tylenol capsules.  Some hunk of human detritus had replaced the acetaminophen in the capsule with cyanide.  Poison.




So innocent people—young, old, didn’t matter—were dying.  America panicked.  I remember watching _Nightline with Ted Koppel_ and hearing that we are pretty defenseless against a monster bent on murder.




Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of Tylenol’s manufacturer, immediately pulled all forms of Tylenol from the distribution chain.  They didn’t wait for a government order. They didn’t wait to add up the costs.  In this case, Johnson & Johnson valued human lives more than quarterly profit—even more than they valued one of the best-selling brands in the world.




Why do I puke when I hear that story?  Because it seems to be the only example in the history of American business in which a company put people before profit. Instead of being a lesson that business leaders follow, it’s an outlier that business students read and forget when they rise to the C-suite.




Thankfully, Southwest Airlines just gave business textbook writers a new case study.




When a chunk of the fuselage fell off of a Southwest Airlines flight last week, the company grounded the fleet for inspection. Just as J&J did 30 years ago, Southwest acted to save lives. They didn’t add up the costs and then decide right from wrong.  They chose the right path at any price.




The [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704630004576249144015341786.html?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories) has more:




<blockquote>Typically, airlines wait for regulatory direction and manufacturer recommendations before removing planes from service. In this case, that was a tricky proposition—partly because [Boeing](http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=BA)Co. was temporarily caught off guard and regulators didn't know what initial action to take.

That’s right. The all-powerful government to whom so many want to surrender all responsibility was frozen, but a private, for-profit company was fluid.  Southwest did the unthinkable—grounding is fleet.




Yes, passengers were upset.  And people were stranded. And it will take time for Southwest to recover.




But no one has died from a cracked fuselage since the problem happened.  Human lives, not quarterly profits, drove Southwest.




What drives you?
