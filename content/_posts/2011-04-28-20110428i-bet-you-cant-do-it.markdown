I hope you can, but I doubt it. If you think you can, please comment before and after. 




[![tps_report[1]]()
]()Go one work week without uttering a single acronym or abbreviation. No ASAPs, no TPS Reports, no MRIs.




Recently, two dozen people sat around a board room table. I was one of them. After 30 minutes it was all I could do to stay in the damn room. 




“We have acronyms for _every_thing,” one woman said.




Not to be outdone, representatives from three other organizations one-upped her. “We have _books_ to define all our acronyms.” “New people can’t even figure out what _do_ with all our abbreviations.”




And they all laugh. 




I slapped the table.




“Would you people listen to yourselves?” I hissed. “You’re _bragging_ about being unintelligible. Like it’s respectable to speak in gobbledygook.”




Actually, I smiled like an idiot and continued the meeting. But I _wanted_ to fix the real problem.




Arcane speech kills understanding. Abbreviations hide meaning. Acronyms scream “contrived.” 




Go on a five day acronym and abbreviation diet. You can write ‘em, but don’t say ‘em.




Don’t forget to tell us that you’re taking the challenge before you start. And tell us how you did when the week is up.
