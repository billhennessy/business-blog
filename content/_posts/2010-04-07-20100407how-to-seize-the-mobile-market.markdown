You are losing money, readers, and friends if your web site is not optimized for mobile.




Most of the time I spend browsing favorite sites is spent on my T-Mobile Dash. I use Google Reader to gather them together in one spot. But there are many sites that I would read regularly if they hadn't pissed me off the first time I linked to them via Reader. That's because about half of these sites have not been optimized for mobile browsing.




By "optimized," I mean made seemlessly accessible and enjoyable from a mobile device. I do not mean having some special link or URL. If you type http://blog.hennessygrp.com into your mobile browser, you will see [something like this](http://ideaseeds.mofuse.mobi/). This is a free service from MoFuse.com which provides a WordPress plug-in to automatically redirect mobile browsers to the mobile version. It took me 2 minutes to set up, and it makes my readers' lives better. If you don't like MoFuse or don't use WordPress, there are hundreds of other options. Google 'make website mobile'. If you're a do-it-yourselfer, check out this [article](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/07/make-your-site-mobile-friendly).




When I read that 15 percent of iPhone users do not browse the web from their devices, I figures it's because they like web sites run by people or companies who don't care enough to provide a mobile version of their sites. That's too bad. It leaves money on the table and irritates would-be fans.
