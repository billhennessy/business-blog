My wife teaches kids with special needs.
She started back to school this week, getting her room ready for the little ones who arrive next week.




Until I got to 8th grade and discovered girls, I hated the end of summer. That's why this vintage Coke commercial depressed me.

Then, once I started looking forward to fall, Coke stopped playing the commercial.




If you're sweltering in the August heat, remember: fall is just around the corner.




Glad I found it. Hope you like it.
