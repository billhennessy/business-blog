It’s easy to get to the point in an email:




1. Decide what’s important.




2. Write that.




3. Decide whether any background information would help. For example, would adding “Mary called in sick,” explain your email question, “Should I cover the front desk?” 




4. If background’s necessary, add it.




5. Click Send.
