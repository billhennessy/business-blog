If you don't know what "[gamification](http://gamification.com/)" is, you're in big trouble.
Salesforce.com, SAP, Cisco, and many other companies (big and small) are using gamification and game science to increase engagement among distributors, sales forces, customers, and employees.




Gamification is simply designing systems, programs, and products with a game designer's eye.  It's about putting the user first, satisfying the same drives and emotions that keep people playing Angry Birds, Draw Something, or World of Warcraft. And it makes non-games more fun.




In other words, it's great design. And this white paper tells the story.

I have been lucky to work with leaders in the field, like [Rajat Paharia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=rtOoNR83Thw), founder of [Bunchball](http://www.bunchball.com/), [Natron Baxter](http://natronbaxter.com/), and [Barry Kirk](http://pinterest.com/barrykirk/the-board-of-gamification/), a leader in the introduction of game science to the motivation, incentive, employee engagement, and consumer loyalty worlds.




Nicki Powers, a pioneer in the emerging field of engagement design, drove the development of this white paper, along with Barry Kirk.  I fed them a quote or something, but they were kind enough to put my name on the cover. :-)




Please download the white paper and pass around the link.  Get your company on board with gamification.  It makes work fun.
