At issue: values. 




Too often, people don't believe what their employers' believe. More and more people believe that naked pursuit of profit can lead people and companies astray. In his new book, _Anything You Want_, CD Baby founder Derek Sivers describes how one Las Vegas cabbie reveals the danger of the pure profit motive:




<blockquote>I was in Las Vegas for a conference, taking a taxi from the airport to the hotel. I asked the driver, "How long have you lived here?"

> He said, "Twenty-seven years."

> 
> "Wow! A lot has changed since then, huh?"

> 
> "Yeah. I miss the mob."

> "Huh? Really? What do you mean?"

> "When the mafia ran this town, it was fun. There were only two numbers that mattered: how much was coming in, and how much was going out. As long as there was more in than out, everyone was happy. But then the whole town was bought up by these damn corporations full of MBA weasels micro-managing, trying to maximize the profit from every square foot of floor space. Now the place that used to put ketchup on my hotdog tells me it'll be an extra twenty-five cents for ketchup! It sucked all the fun out of this town! Yeah... I miss the mob."

If the people who work for you would rather work for the Mafia, you'd better figure out what you really stand for. And now.
