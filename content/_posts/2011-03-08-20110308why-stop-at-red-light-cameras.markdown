I’ve written about this before. 




The problem with traffic signals is that they make all of the problems they’re designed to solve worse. By “all the problems” I mean:





  * Pollution  
  * Congestion  
  * Deaths  
  * Accidents  
  * Speed of Transit  
  * Risk to pedestrians (except those with certain disabilities)



[Banning red light cameras](http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/03/04/1028077/retired-cop-files-bill-to-ban.html) is a great first step, but the ultimate goal should be elimination of traffic lights altogether.




Watch both episodes. Decide for yourself.

Turning the lights off worked. 





  * Less pollution  
  * Fewer accidents (cars and pedestrians)  
  * Less congestion  
  * Shorter commutes  
  * Safer roads  
  * Happier people  
  * Up to 20 percent better fuel economy
