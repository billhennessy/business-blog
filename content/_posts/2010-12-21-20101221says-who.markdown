Who decides which practices are the best ones?  




I hear all the time about [best practices](http://info.k4health.org/practices.shtml). Every company I’ve worked with in the past 12 years talked about following best practices.  




What I don't know (what they’ve never bothered to explain) is who decides something is a best practice. These are [weasel words](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/08/weasels.html)--a new way of saying “everybody’s doing it.” 




I’ll believe that a practice really is best when it produces higher quality, better profits, more flexibility, and happier people.




Until then, just be honest and say, “this is the way I prefer doing things.”
