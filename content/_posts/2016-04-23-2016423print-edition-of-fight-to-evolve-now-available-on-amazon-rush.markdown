Most of my readers asked for a print edition of my new book, [Fight to Evolve: The Government’s Secret War on NTX](http://amzn.to/1SX2uY4).

Great news! Your book is waiting for you on Amazon. It’s just $17.99, and you’ll be happy to know that I don’t get a penny from the sales. All proceeds go to the Coalition for Safer Drinking and its fight to reduce alcohol’s negative effects on health.

If you, like me, prefer electronic books, you can get the [Kindle version of Fight to Evolve ](http://amzn.to/1ptvxe2)for just $3.99 today, too.

If you know someone who drinks and you worry about their health, be a friend and buy a copy of Fight to Evolve for them, too. Two hardbound copies are about the same price as on bottle of good vodka. And you might save a life.
