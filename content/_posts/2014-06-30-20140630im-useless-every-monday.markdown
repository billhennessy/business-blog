There's one day a week when my work quality sucks. It's Monday. Don't expect something great from me on Monday.
The reason is simple: I can't sleep on Sunday nights.




Here's my sleep quality chart. This over a five-month period, so there are plenty of data points:

Amazing, isn't it?




I'm writing this at 5:30 a.m. Monday. I've been up since 1:30. I tried to sleep twice in between, but I can't. Just doesn't work.




I got three hours of actual sleep. That's better than nothing, but I'll be pretty useless all day today.




I've also tracked other factors. I don't drink on Sundays. I workout, which is supposed to aid sleep. I go to bed at a normal time. I don't drink caffeine.




Nothing seems to help. I've tried over-the-counter sleep pills. They work every night but Sunday. I've tried herbal teas. No dice. I've tried getting up early on Sunday mornings. Nope. Avoiding blue light. Nada.




Everything I've tried yields the same result. I'm aslepp 10 minutes after getting in bed, then I'm awake three hours later. Wide awake. I lie there for 30 minutes, then give up and go downstairs. I read. I write. I walk around. I drive around. Then I go back to bed and try again.




I just can't sleep on Sundays. Haven't been able to in years.




And it's not that I'm not tired. Right now, I'd kill for an hour's sleep. By 8:00 a.m. I'll be able to sleep like a baby, but then I can't. The whole world works Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. No exceptions despite all the talk of flex hours. Clients want you there normal hours.




So I begin another week as a zombie.




If you have any advice that doesn't involve sleeping pills, exercise, caffeine avoidance, not eating after 8 p.m., or herbal teas, please let me know.







Thanks.
