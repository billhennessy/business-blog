We have two big mirrors in our bathroom. It's hard to go through morning and evening routines without seeing yourself. Shower. Shave. You have to keep your eyes open.
But I managed to avoid my reflection for a couple of years.




I also avoided the pool and beaches.




In December of 2011, most of my pants were tight. They all had 38-inch waists. I'm 6'1".




So I book [Timothy Ferriss's awesome book The Four-Hour Body](http://fourhourbody.com/). I read it in two nights.




I tried everything: the diets, the workouts, the ice baths. (Yes, there's ice baths.)




Of all the great advice--and a wonderful writing--one tip stood out.




Now, I weigh 180. And I'm still 6'1".  That's 35 lbs.




I'm also running three miles three times a week and doing weights and full-body, high energy workouts two days a week. And I take two or three weeks off everything four times a year.




And 34-inch waists are little loose.




What was that one thing that I give all the credit to?




Breakfast.




I modified Ferriss's a bit. And I eat the same thing every day.




Ready?





  * 2 eggs (with that [wonderful, nutritious, healthy yolk](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/food-myths-debunked-eating-eggs-raises-your-cholesterol-level.html#b)) any way you like it
  * 1 cup chopped frozen spinach, microwaved
  * 1/2 cup medium salsa (no sugar added)



I fry the eggs over medium and eat them by themselves.




I mix the cold salsa into the hot spinach. It's really good. (You could serve this as the vegetable with dinner.)




That's it.




It takes about 4 minutes to prepare. The green tea or coffee takes longer.




Here are some of the benefits of this routine:





  * I'm full through lunch, 5 hours later
  * I get more than half my veggies before leaving the house
  * I really like the spinach-salsa combination
  * The capsaicin in the salsa increases metabolism
  * I don't have to think about what to eat for breakfast
  * It costs less than a dollar a day
  * It's only about 250 calories



Will eating this breakfast every day work all by itself?




No. But it's a start. Committing to this simple and life-simplifying routine will get you started. It's one easy step.




Your motivation will increase. You'll think about walking for 10 minutes a day. Then 20.




It took me 1.5 years to lose 35 lbs. Maybe that's too slow, but I got stronger and fitter in the process.




You can too. Just take it easy. And start with a simple breakfast routine that includes tons of antioxidants, protein, and fiber.




And skip the bread.
