You've heard the cliche.
We all have.




But you don't know what it means until you feel it.




I've only experienced it a few times, but I've put my money where my mouth is twice in the past year.




First, I've bought 14 copies of Eric Greitens' remarkable book [Resilience](http://amzn.to/1RIeRIq). Twelve were gifts to people who would appreciate the message--or who needed the message. In that experience, **I realized a feeling of power and generosity that literally made me dizzy.** And it paid off.




One person who received a gift-book hosted a dinner party exclusively to discuss a key point of Greitens' work: the morality of results vs. the morality of intentions.




Can you imagine a stronger endorsement of a book than to host a party to talk about it?




Second, after spending two weeks studying and practicing [Running Lean](http://amzn.to/1RnBQIY) and the [Lean Stack](http://leanstack.com) by Ash Maurya, I offered several trusted colleagues a free copy of the book. Immediately they either took the offer or bought the book themselves.




The lesson: **when you put our money where your mouth is, so will others**.




Ideas spread when people repeat them. But they spread faster and deeper when people invest in them.




If you believe in something, spend a little money. Buying someone a book that inspires you is a pretty cheap way to put your money where your mouth is.
