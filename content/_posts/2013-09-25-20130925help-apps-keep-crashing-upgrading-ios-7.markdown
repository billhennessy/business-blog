I thought I'd made a mistake.
Three of the first four apps I opened after upgrading my iPhone 5 to iOS 7 crashed. They just disappeared.




"Crap!"




But when I opened them a second time, they stayed open. And worked.




So I asked my friend Tim, a tech guru who's been experimenting with operating systems and languages for years.




Apparently, the apps that crash weren't ready for the upgrade to iOS 7. They needed to update some bit. That happens the first time you open them with the new operating system.




After that, the apps sync and everything's fine.




But if they keep crashing, then blame the app maker.




Some app developers didn't test their apps on iOS 7 after Apple released the new OS to its developer network. There's no excuse for that. App developers should have been on the new OS the minute it was available. But people are people.




So remember, if it crashes once, try it again. If it stays up the second time, you're fine. If it crashes again, contact the app developer.
