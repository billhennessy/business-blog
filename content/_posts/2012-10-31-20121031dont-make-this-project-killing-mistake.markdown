How many times have you added people (aka "resources") to help a project move faster?

Anyone who's led a software development project knows the drill:




  
  * Scope the project 
  * Define the requirements 
  * Estimate the hours 
  * Pick your deadline 
  * Divide the hours among workers until the project fits under the deadline



It doesn't work. And when things go bad, when timelines shift, when the slack is gone, you do what? **You add more people, and things get worse.**




Software development, by the way, is not the only discipline guilty of the Big Team fallacy. I see it in projects of every kind--from marketing to employee engagement, to cost-cutting projects.




##### Teams Don't Scale The Way You Think They Do




In 1975, [Fred Brooks told us that adding more people to a late project can only make it later](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959). Did we listen? Maybe we'll listen this time.




A new study, [The Team Scaling Fallacy: Underestimating The Declining Efficiency of Larger Teams](http://public.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Faculty/staatsb/neglect.pdf), researchers Bradley R. Staats, Katherine L. Milkman, and Craig R. Fox found that s**maller teams outperform larger teams given the same tasks. **ï»¿




**When the researchers doubled the size of teams working on a task, the time to complete the task increased 70 percent. **Specifically, a two-person team assigned to assemble 50 Legos required 36 minutes to complete the task. When teams of four attempted the same task, the time increased to 52 minutes.




##### Small Team Estimates Are More Accurate




What surprised me, though, was the estimates. The researchers paid graduate students to estimate the time each team would require. They got a bonus if they were right. The students gave lower time estimates for two-person teams than for four-person teams. This seems to indicate that students with little or no work experience understand that larger teams take more time. (We seem to forget this when we take on a management job.) Here's what the researchers observed:




<blockquote>[A]lthough estimators recognized that larger teams would require more time to complete the LEGO assembly project, they were still relatively insensitive to the impact that team size can have on the total amount of effort that a project requires.

In other words, people are terrible at project estimation, and adding people to the project only makes us worse.




##### Keep Teams Small




If you're going to miss the deadline, deal with it. Throwing more people at a project will only make it later. Plus, there are numerous benefits to small teams.




  
  * Small teams are easier to manage 
  * Small teams cost less 
  * Small teams are more productive 
  * Small teams are more nimble



In The Mythical Man-Month, Fred Brooks said it best: nine women can't produce a baby in one month. Keep the teams small and keep your deadlines reasonable. You'll save money and reputation.
