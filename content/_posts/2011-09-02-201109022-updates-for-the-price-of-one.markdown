**Gamification**




For two years, I've been assisting [Barry Kirk](http://www.maritz.com/News-Events-and-Insights/Social-Community/Man-vs-Brand.aspx) with bringing game science into consumer loyalty, sales incentives, and employee engagement. For most of that time, we've been lucky enough to work with the great people at [Bunchball, the world leader in gamification](http://bunchball.com/).




Last week, Bunchball's latest invention, [Nitro for Salesforce](http://bunchball.com/products/nitroforsalesforce), won [AppQuest 2011](http://developer.force.com/appquest11): Best New Salesforce App.

That's quite an endorsement of[ Rajat Praharia's vision](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCfUFpZUk6s), which now powers some of the most popular entertainment sites on the web.




That's also a validation of the gamification concept.  Using the game designer's toolkit when designing non-game events, applications, and programs gives people a better experience. People respond to better experiences with increased participation.  That's a simple concept, and it's getting serious traction.




No matter what field you're in, if it involves people, it will benefit from game science and persuasive design thinking.  You can get started with [Bunchball's new Nitro Elements](http://elements.bunchball.com/about-fanbox.php) tool for instant gamification.  Try it on your blog or website. It's a great Labor Day project.







**Standing Desk**




In June, I told you about [my experiment with a standing desk](http://billhennessy.com/s/standing-for-somethingstanding-for-something?format=original).  I've received some emails about how that experiment is going, so I figured I should update my progress.




First, I'm still standing. It seems more natural to begin work now.  When I enter my office, I have a straight line to my workstation.  When I want to take a break, I simply turn an walk. I like that feeling of freedom.




Second, I'm more productive. At least I feel more productive.  I focus better standing.  I work in short, intense bursts of activity.  Over the course of one hour, I accomplish more than when I'm sitting.




Third, like Gamfication, [standing desks are becoming commonplace](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904199404576541011003270644.html?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read).  Right after I started standing, I took a tour of HON Office Furniture's headquarters in Muscatine, Iowa.  About half of their employees requested standing desks during a recent renovation. 




Now, Facebook reports that more of its employees want standing desks.  The Wall Street Journal online points out that people are learning of the health risks associated with sitting:




<blockquote>A 2010 study by the American Cancer Society found that women who sat more than six hours a day were 37% more likely to die prematurely than women who sat for less than three hours, while the early-death rate for men was 18% higher. The American College of Cardiology released a study in January that found increased mortality among people who sat longer at home than those who didn't.

</blockquote>




The back and neck problems that first inspired me to stand up are mostly gone.  I get a twinge in my neck only when I've been sitting and typing for long stretches. That usually happens only during long meetings.




If you'd like to try standing, it's simple. I [built a wooden desk topper](http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/import-gevk/JteuzjzHrkvzrdgjdloHumDhihBFHeFdHzxigtsrEprvjAzHBvIkntlylwyb/media_httphennessysvi_toIfj.jpg.scaled500.jpg) from materials available at The Home Depot for about $40.  Others have created [desk toppers for less](http://lifehacker.com/5220094/create-a-simple-standing-desk-for-20).
