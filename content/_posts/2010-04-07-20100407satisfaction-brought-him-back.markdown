](http://blog.hennessygrp.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/iStock_000008705997XSmall.jpg) In 2008, an executive challenged his people to write down two or three “[unmentionables](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/06/whats-off-the-table.html)”: issues that were brewing at the water cooler, but were too touchy to raise to management. One person expressed his concern about a lack of understanding of the differences between selling to businesses and selling to consumers. He used the standard abbreviations B2B and B2C.




The executive committed a compound faux pas. First, he attempted to read the missives aloud to a group. Second, he had no idea what the abbreviations stood for. After beginning with “Bee too . . .” the executive started over, substituting “Zee” for “Two.” 




Confidently, he announced, “Web tools that work for BeeZeeBee clients do not engage consumers in a BeeZeeSee program.” He went on to read the rest of the paragraph amid sniggers from his direct reports and their direct reports. He permanently lost credibility with the smartest people in the room.




The executive stopped learning long before this embarrassing episode. Having achieved vice president, he figured he was done. Nothing left to do but cost to retirement. He lost his curiosity. 




If you find yourself confused by a phrase or word, learn it. Then learn its history. Then learn at least two adjacent ideas. If you don’t believe me, [believe Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/06/when-smart-people-are-hard-to-understand.html). If you cannot bring yourself to remain curious about everything related to the business you’re in, then get the hell out. Lack of curiosity makes you look like an idiot and steals money from your employer. Those who depend on you for leadership will lose their jobs because your department will cost the company money and opportunity.
