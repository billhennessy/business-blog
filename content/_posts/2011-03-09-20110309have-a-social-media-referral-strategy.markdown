Twitter and facebook can bring a lot of new customers your way, especially through social referrals. With a little planning and strategy, you can stack the deck to attract new customers who share a lot in common with your best and most loyal customers. 




**Quick Story**




During a program redesign, the topic of referrals came up. I was looking for a place to deploy our new social media referral tools. In the course of the conversation, though, I decided to pull back the referral option. 




Why would a proponent of this exciting new technology pull it off the table? 




Simple: this program didn't fit the profile for a social media referral strategy. 




**Social Media Referrals Are Different**




If the program were a classic loyalty program aimed at top and near-top customer segments, I’d have pushed on. But this program was more of a promotion aimed at price-driven customers. To illustrate my reasoning, let’s look at the difference between a social media referral and a traditional referral. 




The last time I bought a new car, the salesman worked hard to get names of people I knew who needed or wanted a new car. He asked me to give his card and a gift certificate to friends who loved the new vehicle. 




This is traditional referral. Get a customer to refer you to people they know who are likely to want whatever they just bought. 




**But that’s not how social media referrals work.**




When I tweet out that I just bought a car from Joe Carr’s Used Cars, thousands of my followers will see it. And they couldn’t care less. No one follows me to find out where I bought my car. They follow me for other reasons. 




If I tweeted, however, that "@Joe_Carr_Cars the most honest car dealership in town,” people might pay attention. Followers who appreciate honesty will take note. Likewise, if I tweet that @Joe_Carr_Cars fixed a squeak for free,” people motivated by reliability will take note. 




Now, suppose I tweet, "@Joe_Carr_Cars car prices are the cheapest in town-20 percent below Blue Book.” Who will flock to Joe’s? People who value integrity? Maybe. People who treasure reliability? Perhaps. People looking to pay very little? Absolutely. 




**Social Media Referral Strategy**




Simply requiring customers to earn the privilege of referring will improve the quality of referrals you get through social media. For example, “Achieve level 3 to unlock the Referral Tool.” Then give customers the opportunity to earn something of value for their referral efforts. You’ve made the act of referring more interesting while attracting new customers who look like your best customers.
