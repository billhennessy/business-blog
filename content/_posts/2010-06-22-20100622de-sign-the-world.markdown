Google’s success as a search engine has nothing to do with its algorithm. It has everything to do with design. When you land on [www.google.com](http://www.google.com), there is nothing to do but enter a word or phrase into the lone box and wait for an answer. No instructions necessary. No signs.

The more signs we post, the more accidents occur. 




In Holland, a study showed that by simply removing warning signs along dangerous stretches of road, the number of accidents dropped. So the [Dutch are replacing dangerous intersections](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.12/traffic.html) containing tons of signs and signals with simple roundabouts, or traffic circles. The result? [Less congestion, fewer accidents, and a more visually appealing roadway](http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brad-wilmouth/2009/09/11/cbs-finds-less-govt-regulation-means-fewer-traffic-accidents-dutch-town). 




I believe we can spread this finding across many areas of life: how we design software systems, how we treat employees, [how we design buildings](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/06/dont-snowglobe-me-bro.html). In fact, if we must have a rule, let’s make it this: no signs, no warnings, no helpful little messages to users.




Hans Monderman is a Dutch traffic engineer who’s championed the elimination of road signs.




<blockquote>Monderman considers most signs to be not only annoying but downright dangerous. To him, they are an admission of failure, a sign - literally - that a road designer somewhere hasn't done his job. "The trouble with traffic engineers is that when there's a problem with a road, they always try to add something," Monderman says. "To my mind, it's much better to remove things."

In software design, this means software would require almost no documentation. Forms on a web page would have to be self-explanatory. Every page would need to be extremely minimalistic to avoid distraction and confusion. By eliminating the crutch of signs, we must eliminate the problems that make signs seem necessary. 




In the end, outlawing signs requires good design. Like Google’s simple search page.

Try this today. Rip out just one sign that you’re responsible for. And remove the impediment, the hidden danger, or the complexity that made the sign seem necessary.




  
  * Is there a “Watch Your Step” sign nearby? Why don’t you remove the trip-hazard and the sign? 
  * Does the application you’re building have a paragraph of text to explain how to fill out the form? Redesign the form so that the user can’t screw up. 
  * Does a door say “Push?” Why not replace the handle with push bar so that the door’s swing direction is obvious. 



Designing to make signs unnecessary makes the world safer, easier to use, and aesthetically more beautiful. We can all share that responsibility.
