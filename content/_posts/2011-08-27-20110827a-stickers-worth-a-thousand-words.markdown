How can you get people to talk to each other?
Give them a sticker.




At a recent conference, I ran a little experiment.  I wanted to see if I could persuade people to hang around and talk to each other after a breakout session. Too often, people attend conferences as if they were watching at home on Skype. I wanted to persuade people to get more of what they paid for, by meeting and getting to know some interesting people.




#### **The Experiment**




I gave each person two stickers as they entered a meeting room. I asked them to save the stickers for the end. If anyone says something or asks a question you think is great, grab them before they get out of the room, give them a sticker, and let them know you appreicated their input.




I had observed the audience at the morning vesion of the same session, so I use that as a control group.  In the control, about two-thirds of the audience simply left the room after the Q&A.  Of those who remained, half waited to talk to the presenters, and the other half talked to a friend in the room.




#### **Results**




When I added the little mechanic of a sticker as a token of appreciation, things changed dramatically.  In the afternoon session, about three-quarters of the audience hung around, exchanged stickers,and chatted with each other.  That was a wopping 480 percent increase over the control group.

But I observed another change: the afternoon conversations were longer.  The five people who stayed to talk to another audience member in the morning cleared the room in about 4 minutes. But the afternoon crowd with the stickers stayed for 11 minutes--a 275 percent increase.  In fact, the conversations delayed the start of the next session while we tried to clear the room.

#### **Conclusion**




Since the average person speaks about 100 words per minute, and the tokens inspire an 11 minute talk, each sticker is worth more than 1,000 words.
