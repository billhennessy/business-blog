Ever been tempted to respond to your critics? To explain yourself? To educate the public on the real story, the thorny details your critic left out?

I know how tempting response can be. We want to set the record straight, clear our good name, put them in their place. Calling it “vengeance” would be to sell short almighty truth!

But no one ever listens to the respondent. I know Voltaire (or somebody like him) said a charge unanswered is charge agreed to (or something like that).

I say a charge ignored is charge unworthy of our attention.

If it makes you feel any better, Don Draper agrees with me. And this clip from the AMC original series Mad Men empowers us with the perfect attitude toward critics.
