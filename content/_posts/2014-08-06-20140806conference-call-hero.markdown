Have you ever tried dialing into a conference call from a smart phone?![dialing](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56c87f52356fb0ec8c23c9b7/56d09050d9fd567b5dd38d8b/56d0905ad9fd567b5dd38eda/1456509801061/dialing.jpg)

I know—that sounds rhetorical. But seriously, it's a pain, isn't it?




You look up the number in calender. You try to memorize the 7-digit conference id, then press on the hyperlinked phone number to start the call.




You listen to annoying "Welcome to the Meeting Place. Please enter your meeting id at the beep, followed the pound sign."




Try to remember that number now when the pressure's on:




<blockquote>__8-2-9-1-4-0-9-_#_
> 
> 

> 
> "Eight-two-nine-one-four-zero-nine is not a recognized meeting id. Please check your number and try again.![cell-phone-conf-call](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56c87f52356fb0ec8c23c9b7/56d09050d9fd567b5dd38d8b/56d0905ad9fd567b5dd38ee2/1456509810357/cell-phone-conf-call.png)

> 
> 

> 
> _8-2-9-1-0-4-9-#_
> 
> 

> 
> "I'm sorry. Eight-two-nine-one-zero-four-nine is incorrect. Please contact someone smart enough to dial a phone and try again. Good bye, idiot!"
> 
> </blockquote>




Now you're late.




Well, I can't help you. But I can help you help the people you invite to meetings. Here's how:




When you send out the meeting invitation, include both a human-readable version of the call-in number and a smart-phone friendly version. Here's an example:




<blockquote>Call-in number: 1(800)555-9797 conference id 829-1490#
> 
> 

> 
> Smart-phone friendly: 18005559797,,8291490#
> 
> </blockquote>




The two commas will instruct the caller's smart phone to pause for a few seconds, then it will continue sending the rest of the digits and the pound sign.




Now, your guests only need to press the hyperlink and wait to say their names.




Your meeting guests will totally think you're the coolest person on the planet. You'll be known in the circles that matter as "the woman who make conference calls possible on smart phones."




Is that insanely simple, or what?
