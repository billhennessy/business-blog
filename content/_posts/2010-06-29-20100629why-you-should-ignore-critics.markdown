Some people who’ve learned [ways to ignore critics](http://billhennessy.net/2010/06/03/how-to-ignore-critics/) still haven’t accepted the “why.”  My mistake. I should have been more pointed in my explanation of why it’s important to pay less attention to your critics and more attention to what you’re trying to achieve. And for whom.
There are two kinds of critics. The first are your fans who want you to be even better.  The Harley owners who advocate for a longer clutch pedal, the Starbuck’s regulars who ask for free cups of water with their very sweet drink. Listen to these fans. And respond.  You don’t have to do as they ask, but you must tell them you heard and chose not to act.  They will remain faithful because they trust you and want you to succeed.

Then there’s the other kind of critic.  Enemies. They want you to fail. These critics are the Serpent. Their message is intriguing, often seductive. They get you all balled up in emotions. They lead you to suspect your allies and doubt your plans.  They pose questions that suggest you are failing—and offer useful advice. They warn you of division in your ranks.




It’s a trap.




Remember that the Serpent is the Father of Lies.  The Great Deceiver.  Arguing with the devil is useless.  He talks in circles, and all the while he pulls you further away from your mission.  You can argue with the devil, or you can work. You cannot do both.




When the evil critics scoff and mock, remember [the exorcist’s advice to Father Karras](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/):




<blockquote>He is a liar. The demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological, Damien, and powerful. So don't listen to him. Remember that - do not listen.

If you’re trying to change the world, the parts of the world that don’t want to change will talk about your failures.  When you form a powerful coalition, your enemies will talk about fractures.  When you speak the truth, the demons will call you a liar.




Don’t listen.




Instead, march on.  Talk to your advocates. Follow Patton’s advice: “When in doubt, attack.”  Keep moving.  Don’t listen to the critics.  As Winston Churchill said, “If you are going through Hell, keep going.”
