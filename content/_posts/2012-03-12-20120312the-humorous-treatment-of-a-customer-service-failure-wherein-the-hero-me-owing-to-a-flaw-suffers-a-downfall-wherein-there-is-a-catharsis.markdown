My goal seemed simple.  Everything I read told me so.




Plus, I've been IT for most of my adult life, as both a systems guy and programmer.

How hard could it possibly be to move a WordPress blog from a private hoster to WordPress.com?




Turns out, it's not hard at all unless something goes wrong.




**Quick Outline**




I was importing my archives into WordPress.com according to the directions.  I divided the whole thing into 8 smaller files to minimize risk of failure.




The first 5 file loaded fine.  The sixth one failed.




I got an email telling me to open a support ticket, and someone would fix the problem within 24 hours.




That was eight days and about five support tickets ago.  No one from WordPress.com has contacted me. Just  auto-reply emails saying "we got your message."




**I Tried**




Here are my support tickets.  Let me know if you think I deserve to be ignored.  (I've already paid them $12, btw.)

Import failed.  Import shows import still running, but I received an email more than 24 hours ago that the import failed.

I received an email on Friday, March 2, that my import failed for unknown reasons. I cannot try again, because the WordPress import screen in the admin tool still says there's an import in progress and that I should contact support if I haven't heard anything in 24 hours.




It's been about 48 hours now.  I was hoping to get the site moved this weekend.  Could you, at least, let me know when the error might be cleared so I can continue moving data to the site?




Thanks.

**Subject**:   What I Really Want to Know




Did I do something wrong?




I just want to move my blog from a self-hosted site to WordPress.com. I'm tired of managing everything myself and paying a lot every month for hosting.




Last Friday, the import process failed. I'm importing files exported from my self-hosted WordPress site.




You sent me an email and asked me to open a ticket.  I did.




You said you'd be in touch.  You weren't.




It's been 72 hours, and still no word.




I really, really want to move my blog to your system.  But I'm getting apprehensive.




I see in the forums that a lot of people have trouble getting your attention. And they get a lot of bad advice.  And problems take FOREVER to get resolved.




Is there something I did wrong, besides trying to move my blog to your system?  Is there something I could do to get your attention?




On the other hand, thank you.  You've given me a great topic to blog about on my loyalty marketing and brand building blog.

We meet again.




Well, I meet.  Not sure what you do.




Opening a new ticket has become a daily routine.  A new ticket for the same problem: import failed.




My question now is this: do you actively ignore these tickets?  I mean, do you open them and chuckle at the problems people experience with your service?  Or is it passive, with three guys in Kool-Aid stained t-shirts playing Angry Birds on their iPads as the tickets stack up?




Anyway, write when you get a chance. I'll be here.




Love,




Bill

It's me again.




I hope you weren't too worried that I didn't write yesterday. I'm sorry. The whole day was just a mess. Got called into meetings I didn't know about--long meetings. By the time I got home, my mind was somewhere else.




Anyway, you'll be happy to know that I still can't finish importing my blog. But I'm sure you knew that. You're the one who's ignored these tickets for a week.




That's pretty good. You've gone a whole week without so much as telling me what might be going on.




When I quit smoking, getting to Day Seven was a Very. Big. Deal. I guess it's almost as great to go seven days without addressing a problem that prevents a customer from using your service.




Not to sound like know-it-all, but you might want to stop taking on new customers and new accounts until you figure out to service the ones you already have.




Well, I have to get some sleep now. I'm sure that's never a problem for you, though. I'll write again tomorrow, I'm sure.




Yours,
Bill

**That Did It!**




_Finally_ I got response after posting my March 8 ticket to the public forums for everyone to read.




WordPress.com posted a very polite and understanding reply and let me know they'd fixed the problem.




At least I got some good blog fodder out of it.
