I hear it so often.  "We need to change that, but right now this is more important."




That more important "this" is usually an emergency created because we didn't change the last time. 




This is true of nations, companies, and people.  We recognize the need to change, we're given a map to change, but we're so comfortable in our lethal ways that we'd rather die than fix the problems.




What changes are you putting off until tomorrow? And how heavy is that freeloader on your back?
