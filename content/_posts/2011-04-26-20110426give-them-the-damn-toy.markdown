Mothers get it.
Little Sarah wants her plastic Winnie-the-Pooh doll on the high chair tray next to her thick, yellow training plate while she eats.  Dad takes it away.  Mom sighs.

“What?” Dad says.  “It doesn’t belong there while she’s eating.  She’ll play and get food all over it.”




Mom rolls her eyes.




Little Sarah cries, “I want my Pooh!”




Dad digs in.




It ends in tears, of course, for Dad, anyway. Food lands on the wall. Dad yells and starts to clean. Mom gives Sarah the damn toy. Sarah giggles and eats.




Some firms care more about adherence to an arbitrary process than about results. Some bosses care more about the color of a whiteboard marker than about what the marker’s writing. Some brands care more about selling it to you their way than about making the sale.




Never compromise the magic of your process, your products, or your systems. But when a little concession means buy-in and emotional harmony, give them the damn toy.
