Thomas Jefferson is my hero.




Not just because of his politics, but because** he was the laziest of the Founding Fathers**.




Our 3rd President and libertarian icon accomplished some amazing things in his life. Writing the Declaration of Independence is just one example. He also invented a clock that needed to be wound only one a year, a system for creating copies of letters as he wrote, and (some say) the Lazy Susan.




Why did he create all of these devices and more? Because he was energetic?




No. Because he was lazy. Think about it. Is it really so hard to pull down on a the weight of a grandfather clock every week?




It was for Mr. Jefferson. So was handwriting copies of letters. And reaching across the table for something on the other side.




As a software developer, I appreciate his creative laziness. It's why I write code--so I don't have to do mindless tasks over and over again myself.




**Lazy bloggers also need inspiration.** We need to get the story out without working up a sweat.
