I don't want customers who don't get me. Why try to change the minds of people who don't believe what I believe?  Why not exert that energy delighting people who do?

Last week at a business luncheon, I heard a great story from my colleague. We'll call him Joe, but that's not his real name.  Joe's story illuminated a speck of truth tucked away in the musty corner of a dark old attic.  First, the story.




Joe's an account manager. He's a warm, straightforward guy, too. His company believes that successful companies succeed for all their stakeholders, and Joe believes that wholeheartedly.







A few years ago, though, Joe found himself with a client who didn't believe what Joe's company believes.  This client believed that the only stakeholders who mattered were their board and their executive management.  Customers, employees, partners, vendors were cogs, easily scrapped and replaced.




Joe was miserable trying to do right by a client whose core values Joe found repugnant.




So Joe found a new client to replace the miserable one.  He found a hotel company whose executives believe precisely what Joe and Joe's employer believe:  if you help enough people win, they will make you a champion.




Two years later, Joe, the client, and the relationship are soaring.  More importantly, everyone's happy.  The account is more profitable because it's built on trust.




We do our best work and capture our greatest rewards when we work with customers who already believe what we believe.




More accurately, perhaps, we do best with customers are already live the way we want to live.




All this leads us to two difficult tasks




First, we must uncover and [accept what we believe](http://blog.startwithwhy.com/refocus/2009/10/when-a-why-is-cleareveryone-knows-it.html) about ourselves, our potential, and [work](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/2011/04/how-screenwriters-pitch/).




Next, we need the courage to walk away from disbelievers and do it with a smile. Especially when they're willing to pay us hard, cold cash.
