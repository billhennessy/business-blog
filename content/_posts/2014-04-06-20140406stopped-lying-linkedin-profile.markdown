Do you dread updating your resume? Does the thought of refreshing your LinkedIn profile make want to vomit? If you answered "yes," we have a lot in common. 
My LinkedIn profile was duller than dirt. It read like everybody else's. A bunch of self-serving crap. Who needs that? I wouldn't hire the guy who wrote my LinkedIn profile. I wouldn't want to sit next to him on a long flight, either.




My old profile fit all the recommendations from professional LinkedIn profile advisers. What do they know?




My old profile was a lie. It wasn't me. I don't like typing lists of facts about myself, but my professional resume on LinkedIn was just that: a list of facts.




I'm a storyteller, not a list-maker. Actually, that's not completely true, either. I do make lists. I just don't try to persuade people with lists. I don't try to tell stories or convey facts with lists. I make lists for myself because [James Altucher told me to](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/how-do-you-decide-on-a-given-day-what-ideas-to-come-up-with/).







While I hate writing my own brag sheet, I love writing stories. I like hearing stories, too. Stories draw people in. A list of facts just inspires people to find something wrong with one of them.




So yesterday, I decided to [rewrite my LinkedIn profile as a story](http://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhennessy/). Big risk, I know. Dangerous, yes. Only an idiot would take a huge chance like that with something as important as his LinkedIn profile.  "Are you crazy?"




My company will probably hate me for it, too, since clients look up everybody they work with. I don't care.




Pretending to be the kind of person who promotes himself with lists of achievements is a lie. And there's nothing worse than lying on LinkedIn.




So I stopped lying.




[Go check out my LinkedIn profile ](http://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhennessy/)and tell me what you think. And if you decide to go crazy and turn your profile into a story, please let me know. I'd like to read your story.




**UPDATE**  Two days after I rewrote my LinkedIn profile as a story, I found this post about . . . wait for it . . .[ why you should rewrite your resume as a story](http://qz.com/192347/to-get-a-job-write-your-story-instead-of-a-resume/).  Can't make this stuff up.
