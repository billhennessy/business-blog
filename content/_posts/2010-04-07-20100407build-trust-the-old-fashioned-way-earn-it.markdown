Have you ever looked someone in the eye and decided, in an instant, that you can trust him or her?







What about a business? Do you trust the companies you do business with?







I think people do business with companies they distrust all the time. Most of the time, in fact. If we don't do business with people and companies we distrust, then:




    
  * Why do we have contracts? 
  * Why do we review bank statements? 
  * Why do we insist on warranties and guarantees? 
  * Why do we put funds into escrow? 



The answer is, we don't trust most of the people we do business with. But some we distrust more than others. This trust breaks down a couple of ways:




**Trust in Intention**: Many of our business agreements involve future delivery of a good or service. As vendors, we believe that the customer has every intention of paying for the services we offer. As customers, we believe the vendor honestly intends to deliver. But we get it in writing because we know circumstances change. When they took their vows, Mrs. Sanford believed that Governor Sanford would never betray and humiliate her. Things changed. But she trusted his intention at the time of the wedding or the would not have occured.




**Trust in Representation**: The other kind of trust involves the representation of facts about the past or present. This is a whole different ball game. If Joe tells us he was at home watching "So You Think You Can Dance" last night, but we know that he was actually at a bar with a woman from Argentina, we call Joe a dirty liar. When we lose trust in a person's honesty about the past, we will not sign a contract for the future.




**Why Is This Important?**




Trust is at an all-time low. [Harvard Business Review](http://hbdm.harvardbusiness.org/email/archive/dailystat.php?date=061209) recently devoted an entire issue to rebuilding trust in companies and institutions.

These charts show the level of trust among senior managers and executives toward other executives and consultants. Since 2007, the men and women who run America's businesses have lost faith in the integrity of their fellows. 




More importantly, they seem to have lost the second kind of trust. They no longer trust other companies to tell the truth about _what is or was_. 




Ethically and morally, we've always been required to tell the truth. If we sign up to deliver something in the future (Trust in Intentions), then we deliver, even at great cost to ourselves. If we represent the current state of our business, our capabilities, or our accomplishments, we speak only pure and verifiable truth. But when trust is already low, the slightest hint of dishonesty, of false representation, will permanently destroy a person's reputation. It will also destroy his or her business.




As we emerge from the current recession, look for integrity to be at least as important as capability when people and companies choose vendors.
