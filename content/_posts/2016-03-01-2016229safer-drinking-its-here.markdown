Ever feel a just a little guilty about the drink with friends after work? That beer at the ball game? A glass of wine with dinner?

Â 

Do you pay attention to the studies saying moderate drinking is good for you? Or the ones that follow quickly saying drinking's bad for you?

Do wish you could have a vodka and cranberry juice without guilt or worry?

Well, you can. A research company called Chigurupati Technologies has invented and patented a technology that reduces liver stress from alcohol by over 90 percent. That's better than some fast foods. The technology is called NTX and it's already available in a vodka brand.

Not only does NTX reduce liver damage to near zero, it also protects against the damage alcohol does to your DNA. Not to mention _increasing _the liver's production of antioxidants.

(Read more about [NTX and Chigurupati Technologies here](http://saferalcohol.com/blog/enjoy-a-drink-with-far-less-liver-damage/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss).)

But with all good news there must some bad news, right?

Of course. The US government has put a gag order on Chigurupati Technologies. They're not allowed to tell consumers that vodka with NTX could save their lives. The rotten bureaucracy at the heart of this anti-consumer nonsense is the [Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau](http://www.ttb.gov).

There's an epic battle brewing right now in Washington over safer alcohol. And an organization called the [Coalition for Safer Alcohol](http://saferalcohol.com) has asked me to help in its fight to defend the First Amendment for consumers. The Coalition for Safer Drinking believes it's a good thing that people can drink without getting sick. We're not advocating drinking for people who don't, and we implore people to drink responsibly.

We believe that drinking responsibly includes choosing alcohol that does the least possible amount of body damage. We know that just 15 minutes after your first drink, your liver enzymes show signs of stress, you DNA processes go sideways, and oxidation of your cells increased. We also know, based on two human studies in India and the in the U.S., that alcohol produced with NTX reduces those bodily stresses to the point of insignificance. And we are flummoxed by the government's attempt to hide this lifesaving information from consumers.
