Politics creates incentives to shout, “we lost.” That’s why after every great debate, both sides rush to claim defeat.

Defeats help fire up the emotional base. Screaming, “We’re behind,” helps fundraising.




Here’s why claiming defeat isn’t such a great idea: most people who listen to you are not your base. Nor or they your opponents. Most people listening are concerned people trying to decide which side’s right and which side’s wrong. 




When you declare yourself the winner, some will agree, some won’t. When you declare defeat, everyone will agree with you. Claim defeat often enough, and people will just call you a loser.
